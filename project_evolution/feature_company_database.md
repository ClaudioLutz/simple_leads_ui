# Technical Description: Scalable Company Database

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design for a scalable company database. This database will store information about companies, including their profiles, contact details, and potentially related entities like employees or products.

## Data Schema

The database will utilize a relational schema to ensure data integrity and facilitate complex queries.

**Companies Table:**

*   `company_id` (Primary Key, UUID): Unique identifier for each company.
*   `name` (VARCHAR(255), Not Null): Official name of the company.
*   `legal_name` (VARCHAR(255)): Legal name of the company, if different.
*   `domain` (VARCHAR(255), Unique): Primary website domain of the company.
*   `founding_date` (DATE): Date the company was founded.
*   `company_type` (VARCHAR(100)): Type of company (e.g., Public, Private, Non-profit).
*   `industry` (VARCHAR(100)): Primary industry the company operates in.
*   `short_description` (TEXT): A brief overview of the company.
*   `long_description` (TEXT): A more detailed description of the company's mission and operations.
*   `number_of_employees` (INT): Estimated number of employees.
*   `revenue` (BIGINT): Annual revenue, if available.
*   `headquarters_address` (TEXT): Full address of the company headquarters.
*   `phone_number` (VARCHAR(50)): Primary contact phone number.
*   `email_address` (VARCHAR(255)): Primary contact email address.
*   `logo_url` (VARCHAR(2048)): URL to the company's logo.
*   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of record creation.
*   `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, On Update: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of last record update.

**Company_Social_Media Table:**

*   `social_media_id` (Primary Key, UUID): Unique identifier for each social media entry.
*   `company_id` (Foreign Key, Not Null, References Companies(company_id) ON DELETE CASCADE): The company this social media link belongs to.
*   `platform` (VARCHAR(100), Not Null): Name of the social media platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook).
*   `url` (VARCHAR(2048), Not Null): URL to the company's profile on the platform.
*   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of record creation.
*   `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, On Update: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of last record update.

**Future Considerations (Separate Tables):**

*   **Employees:** Storing key personnel associated with companies.
*   **Products/Services:** Detailing offerings of each company.
*   **Funding Rounds:** Information about investments received.
*   **News Mentions:** Links to articles and news related to companies.

## Technology Choices

**Database:**

*   **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It handles complex queries well, supports JSONB for flexible data types, and has strong community support. For scalability, PostgreSQL offers various replication and partitioning options.

**Backend Language/Framework (Example):**

*   **Python with Django/FastAPI:**
    *   **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Its ORM is robust and simplifies database interactions.
    *   **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Excellent for building microservices that might interact with this database.
*   **Node.js with Express/NestJS:**
    *   **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
    *   **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications, built with and fully supporting TypeScript.

**Deployment & Scalability:**

*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. These providers offer managed PostgreSQL services (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) that handle backups, patching, and scaling.
*   **Containerization:** Docker will be used to containerize the application and database services for consistent environments and easier deployment.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes will be considered for managing containerized applications, enabling automated scaling, load balancing, and service discovery.
*   **Read Replicas:** To scale read-heavy workloads, PostgreSQL read replicas will be implemented.
*   **Connection Pooling:** Tools like PgBouncer will be used to manage database connections efficiently, preventing connection exhaustion.
*   **Caching:** A caching layer (e.g., Redis or Memcached) will be implemented to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.

## Data Migration

If migrating from an existing system, a phased approach will be taken:
1.  Schema mapping and transformation script development.
2.  Initial data dump and load into a staging environment.
3.  Data validation and consistency checks.
4.  Incremental updates to keep staging in sync.
5.  Final cutover with minimal downtime.

## Security Considerations

*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   **At Rest:** Utilize managed database service features for transparent data encryption (TDE).
    *   **In Transit:** Enforce SSL/TLS for all database connections.
*   **Access Control:**
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within PostgreSQL.
    *   Application services will use dedicated database users with least-privilege access.
    *   Network security groups/firewalls to restrict database access to authorized application servers.
*   **Secrets Management:** Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider-specific secret managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager) for database credentials.
*   **Regular Audits:** Implement audit logging for database activities.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Ensure all user inputs and data destined for the database are properly sanitized in the application layer to prevent SQL injection.

## Backup and Recovery

*   Utilize the automated backup features of the managed PostgreSQL service (e.g., point-in-time recovery).
*   Regularly test a disaster recovery plan.
*   Store backups in a geographically separate location if high availability is critical.
